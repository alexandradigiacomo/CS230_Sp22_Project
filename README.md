# White Shark Fin Matching

This repository contains the starting framework for an in-progress project examining the potential to use computer vision techniques to automatically identify white sharks using dorsal fin imagery. Dorsal fin photos were collected at AÃ±o Nuevo state park from 2010-2022 as a part of the Block Lab research program of Stanford University.
